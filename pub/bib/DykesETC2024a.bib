    abstract = {We use query results from manually designed corpus queries for fine-tuning an LLM to identify argumentative fragments as a text mining task. The resulting model outperforms both an LLM fine-tuned on a relatively large manually annotated gold standard of tweets as well as a rule-based approach. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the usefulness of corpus queries to generate training data for complex text categorisation tasks, especially if the targeted category has low prevalence (so that a manually annotated gold standard contains only a small number of positive examples).},
