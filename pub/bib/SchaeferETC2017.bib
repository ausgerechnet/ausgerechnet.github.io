  abstract =	 {In this article, we present results on the
                  identification and behavioral analysis of social
                  bots in a sample of 542,584 tweets, collected before
                  and after Japan's 2014 General Election. Typical
                  forms of bot activity include massive retweeting and
                  repeated posting of (nearly) the same message,
                  sometimes used in combination. We focus on the
                  second method and present (i) a case study on
                  several patterns of bot activity and (ii)
                  methodological considerations on the automatic
                  identification of such patterns and the prerequisite
                  near-duplicate detection. Moreover, (iii) we give
                  qualitative insights into the purposes behind the
                  usage of social/political bots. We argue that it was
                  in the latency of the semi-public sphere of social
                  media – and not in the visible or manifest public
                  sphere (official campaign platform, mass media) –
                  where Abe's hidden nationalist agenda interlocked
                  and overlapped with the one propagated by
                  organizations such as \emph{Nippon Kaigi} and
                  Internet right-wingers (netto uyo) during the
                  election campaign, the latter potentially forming an
                  enormous online support army of Abe's agenda.},
